		<h2> Facts</h2>
		<p> id="interesting"> The males of this species grow to maximum total length of 73 cm (29 in): body 58 cm (23 in), tail 15 cm (5.9 in). 
		Females grow to a maximum total length of 58 cm (23 in). The males are surprisingly long and slender compared to the females.
		The head has a short snout, more so in males than in females. The eyes are large and surrounded by 9–16 circumorbital scales. 
		The orbits (eyes) are separated by 7–9 scales. The nostril is like a slit and separated from the eye by two scales. The eye and the supralabials are separated by a single row of scales. The supralabials number 7-10, of which the fourth is enlarged.
		The body is covered with elongated, heavily keeled dorsal scales that give this species a "shaggy", almost bristly appearance. 
		The scales around the head and neck are the longest, decreasing posteriorly. Midbody, the dorsal scales are in 15–19 rows. 
		There are 149–166 ventral scales and 35–64 subcaudals.</p>
